This is the 3rd version of my personal website, this time built with [Astro][] and [TailwindCSS][].

This is my first multipage application, I'm building it as I learn about Astro and front end web development. Astro was the perfect fit for this project, it enables writing components in an extended HTML syntax while allowing progressive enhancement with client side Javascript frameworks. This makes it an excellent platform for experimenting with more advanced web development techniques and technologies.

My goal for this website is to continuously improve it as I continue to learn more about web development.
