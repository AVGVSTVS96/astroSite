# Astro + TailwindCSS

This is the 3rd version of my personal website, this time built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This latest version of my personal website is my first multipage application and the first website I built from scratch with a framework. Astro was a perfect fit for this project, it's fast, easy to use and has excellent documentation; I was immediately productive with it and referencing the documentation to find whatever I was looking for in a pinch was a breeze.

Astro is truly a joy to work with! I look forward to learning more about it and indulging in its rich featureset as I continue to build with it.
