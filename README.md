# Astro + TailwindCSS

This is the 3rd version of my personal website, this time built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Astro is a fantastic static site generator that allows you to use any framework you want, or none at all. It allows you to use plain HTML components and templates in addition to React, Vue, Svelte, SolidJS, and Preact. It also allows you to use markdown files as pages, which is what I'm doing for my blog posts.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
