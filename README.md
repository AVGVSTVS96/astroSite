# Astro + TailwindCSS

This is the 3rd version of my personal website, this time built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This latest version of my personal website is my first multipage application and the first website I built from scratch with a framework. Astro was a perfect fit for this project, it's fast, easy to use and has excellent documentation; I was immediately productive with it and referencing the documentation to find whatever I was looking for in a pinch was a breeze.

Astro is a joy to work with! As a consequence of it's acessible documentation and intuitive design, building with Astro is a pleasant experience, everything seems to "just work". There isn't any strange complexity, everything is intuitive and clear without compromising on raw power and insane speed, combining the best of static site generators and frontend Javascript frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte into one all encompassing beginner friendly rendering framework.

Building components in HTML is a great way to learn component structure and slowly integrate more complex reactive Javascript framworks likek Svelte and SolidJS as I learn. I'm eager to continue progressing as I learn more about Astro and Javascript frameworks in general.
