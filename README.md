# Astro + TailwindCSS

This is the 3rd version of my personal website, this time built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This latest version of my personal website is my first multipage application and the first website I built from scratch with a framework. Astro was a perfect fit for this project, it's fast, easy to use and has excellent documentation; I was immediately productive with it and referencing the documentation to find whatever I was looking for in a pinch was a breeze.

[Astro](https://astro.build) is a joy to work with! As a consequence of it's acessible documentation and intuitive design, building with Astro is a very enjoyable experience, everything seems to "just work". There isn't any strange complexity, everything is intuitive and simple without compromising on raw power and insane speed, combining the best of SSGs and frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte into one all encompassing beginner friendly rendering framework.

I'm eager to continue progressing as I learn more about [Astro](https://astro.build) and indulging in its rich featureset as I continue to build with it and get familiar with frontned framworks like Svelte and SolidJS to eventually integrate into my Astro projects.
