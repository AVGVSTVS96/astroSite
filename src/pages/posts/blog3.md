Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override. 

Most CSS frameworks do too much. They come with predefined components, like buttons, cards, and modals, that might help you move quickly at first, but cause more pain than they cure when it comes time to make your site stand out with a custom design. 

Tailwind is different. Instead of opinionated predesigned components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.

In this blog post, we will explore how to get started with Tailwind CSS, its core concepts, and how it can help speed up your development workflow. Stay tuned!
