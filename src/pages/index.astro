        In addition, I'm exploring AI and machine learning, seeking to understand and apply these technologies in practical scenarios. My technical repertoire also includes 3D printing—where I skillfully build and maintain printers for precision parts—and drone building, where I apply my electronics and software knowledge to create and pilot high-performance drones.
