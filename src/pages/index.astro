          Based in NY, I'm an IT Professional with a wealth of experience in
          hardware, software management, network operations, cybersecurity, and
          audio-visual systems. Currently, my focus is on advancing my skillset
          in software engineering and web development, utilizing the latest
          programming technologies to enhance user experiences and system
          performance.
        </p>
        <p slot="content">
          In addition, I'm exploring AI and machine learning, seeking to
          understand and apply these technologies in practical scenarios. My
          technical repertoire also includes 3D printing—where I skillfully
          build and maintain printers for precision parts—and drone building,
          where I apply my electronics and software knowledge to create and
          pilot high-performance drones.
